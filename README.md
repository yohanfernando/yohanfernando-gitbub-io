Template of my blog ([view](http://yohanfernando.github.io/))
==================


## About

This is the template of my blog with my details stripped off and ready to 
use/serve as a template for your Jekyll based GitHub pages site*.

**Preview template: [http://yohanfernando.github.io/yohanfernando-github-pages-template/]
(http://yohanfernando.github.io/yohanfernando-github-pages-template/)**
 
\* Require very minimal modifications and may take max 15-20 minutes if you have all 
the images ready.

## How to use

If you wish to use this template in your own site please follow the following steps.  

**First and foremost check out the latest version from my `gh-pages` branch.** 

Here onwards the workflow differs based on the type of site you create, follow appropriate 
instructions to get you set up quickly as possible.
 
#### a. User / Organisation GitHub Pages Site

1. Rename the `gh-pages` branch to be `master` as github pages user/organisation sites 
only get served from the `master` branch

2. Open `_config.yml` file and add your details and site/url specific details to all the places 
where I have noted as `AMEND_HERE`. 

3. Set the value for `baseurl:` as an empty string (`baseurl: ""`) in `_config.yml` file.  

4. Now go to **"Edit Demo Content & Go Live"** section  


#### b. Project GitHub Pages Site

1. Project pages are served from the `gh-pages` branch, so its essential that you keep the same
branch name.

2. Open `_config.yml` file and add your details and site/url specific details to all the places 
where I have noted as `AMEND_HERE`. 

3. Set the value for `baseurl:` as your repository name starting with a "`/`" 
(e.g.- for this template repository its `baseurl: "/yohanfernando-github-pages-template"`) 
in `_config.yml` file.  

4. Now go to **"Edit Demo Content & Go Live"** section  


#### Edit Demo Content & Go Live

1. Add header & author thumbnail images  
    a. add the image you selected for your header background image to the `assets/images` folder    
    b. add the author thumbnails (picture of you / your persona) to the `assets/images` folder.   
    Thumbnails should be in three sizes, 400px x 400px, 300px x 300px and 200px x 200px.    
    c. open `_scss/variables.scss`  
    d. add the relative url (or the full url if hosted externally) of the image you selected for
      your header background image to the `$header-background-image` variable.
      Url should be relative to the 'assets/css/style.css', e.g. "`../images/header.jpg`", 
      i.e. - relative url should start with a "`../images/`" followed by the image name.      
    e. similarly add urls of the author thumbnails. The 400px x 400px should be added 
    to `$site-owner-thumb-lg`, 300px x 300px should be added to `$site-owner-thumb-md` 
    and 200px x 200px should be added to `$site-owner-thumb-sm variables`.   
    f. if you wish to you can amend remaining variables (optional)  
    
    Note: getting the author's face/persona to center may take a few attempts, hence worth 
    testing locally before committing (refer developer guide below for how-to).  
    
2. Edit the about.md with your details, when adding content make sure to either;  
    a. add an "excerpt" as the front matter  
    b. or add the site excerpt_separator from where you want post to be cut off in the home page
     (excerpt_separator is "`<!-- more -->`")

3. Delete all the dummy posts form the "`_posts`" folder and I recommend adding 3-4 posts to start 
with (optional to add, however may break the layout otherwise).

4. Edit the README.md file and add your own description 
 
5. Set the `git origin` with your repository details and push changes to the `origin`.
  
6. Wola, your site is now LIVE :)

7. Send me a message or a tweet ([@yohanfernando](http://twitter.com/yohanfernando)) to say you 
used my template - just to put a smile on my face and as a reward for my hard work :).

 
## How I developed the template

#### Phase 1 - Setup Jekyll base blog

Install all required software to get Jekyll up & running  

* **Ruby** (latest 2.2.2p95) via `brew install ruby`*  
* **Bundler** via `gem install bundler`
* **Jekyll** - you can install either via `gem install github-pages` or create an empty folder 
with below GemFile and run `bundle install` (NB to install github-pages, Xcode need 
to be installed on a Mac).  

    ```js
        source 'https://rubygems.org'   
        gem 'github-pages'  
    ```
  
Now create a base Jekyll site using `jekyll new <site-name>` and copy a version of the  above 
GemFile to the root of that project. This is a good time to initialise Git and add 
a README and LICENSE file to the project.


\* if you donâ€™t use Homebrew I thoroughly recommend trying it out, refer 
[Homebrew Setup Guide](http://brew.sh/)


#### Phase 2 - Setup development environment  

First install npm & bower dependencies.  

* Set up Node as you need to access the npm package manager; a perfect opportunity 
to use `brew install node`. Once installed, create 'package.json' file at the root 
of your project folder.  
* Install bower for adding runtime dependencies via `npm install -g bower` (you can save it 
to your 'package.json' by running the `npm install --save-dev bower` command instead).  

When creating a blog or a basic site with Jekyll you don't need a build system such as 
gulp/grunt. However I thought it will be interesting to setup one to try them out, and 
to configure **browser-sync** or similar to assist my development workflow. 
I decided to use gulp as I have heard a lot of good things about it lately.

* To install gulp as builder tool, run `npm install --global gulp` (you can save it to 
your package.json by running the `npm install --save-dev gulp` command instead).
* Create a basic `gulpfile.js` at the root of your project folder, following is all 
what you need to start.  

    ```js
        var gulp = require('gulp');    
            
        gulp.task('default', function() {
            // place code for your default task here
        });
    ```

Now that we have completed the basic file setup, its a good time to add your personal details & 
information about the site & repositories to `package.json`, `bower.json` and `gulpfile.json` 
and customise them.
 

#### Phase 3 - Setup gulp, add basic info & temp articles for testing


Latest versions of Jekyll comes with a *'watch'* tool that compile the '.md' files and inject to 
the compiled Jekyll site ('_site') without needing a site rebuild each time you make an alteration 
to a blog article / markdown file. Unfortunately as it doesn't auto refresh the page (lazy ei!) 
and doesn't compile config file or static pages, I was motivated to install & configure **gulp** 
to use during the development.    

Although **gulp** is a brilliant build tool it needed to be configured to work with Jekyll & it's 
file structure. For this I had to first build the site using `jekyll build` via a 
gulp child process, then initiate a `gulp watch` on markdown, scss, html & config files, 
and depending on what got changed either inject the compiled files to the jekyll 
output folder ('_site') or rebuild the whole site.  

* First install following npm plugins to assist with the gulp setup  

    ```js
        npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-autoprefixer gulp-rename gulp-sass 
        gulp-open gulp-wait browser-sync  
    ```  

* As I am going to be using Zurb's Foundation framework in the project, install that using 
bower command `bower install foundation --save`  


* I then configured following **gulp** tasks, and when the `gulp serve` command is executed 
following will be executed in order specified below.

    a. `copy-libraries` - copy foundation & bower libraries to assets folder  
    b. `jekyll-build` - build the site using a child process  
    c. `watch` - specify which files to watch  
    d. `serve` - initiate browser-sync and open auto-refresh enabled web page  
    
    *Additionally I also have;*  
    e. `scss` - which will compile scss files on change and inject to _site/assets/css 
    folder ( **NB.**  I changed the path from default 'css/main.scss' to 'assets/css/style.scss')   
    f. `jekyll-rebuild` - which will call 'jekyll-build' task and reload browser-sync  
    g. `default` - which will call 'serve' task  
    

I also created a 'index-new.html' for designing the new layout for my blog and it is using 
the '_layouts/default-new.html'. The 'default-new' layout include the 'head-new.html' which 
has a link to the 'assets/css/style-new.css' which will be my new stylesheet for the blog
which uses foundation framework.  

**Note :** In order to test the site as you develop it is advisable to setup a few dummy 
posts with different types of components in them, which is what I did in the posts folder. 
  
  
  
**Now that I have my build environment setup, I can proceed to the development stage 
and if you use my repo, so can you.**
  
  
#### Phase 4 - Design, structure & style the layouts
    
This is where you pretty much translate the 'ideas' you have in mind to html & css. Due to build 
complexities with Jekyll, I highly recommend developing the layout using a static file and setup 
`gulp` to copy the files to the `_site` folder & refresh the page everytime you make a change. 

During this stage I simply created:  

 * layout for home page  
 * layout for single posts  
 * page to display all the blog articles (if someone visit `../blog/` url of the site)  
 
Once you complete hustling the pages, especially dreaded css, its time to create the layout based 
on that. Best thing to do is stick to the current `_layouts` and `_include` folder structure. 
Separate the html head section, the site header/navbar and the site footer in to different 
includes, and insert them via the layout. For the home page, main body of the page will 
remain in the index.html page and be inserted to the layout via `{{ content }}`. 

On the single page layouts the only thing that get copied via `{{ content }}` is the body of the 
blog post. Hence it is important to output the blog title, author, dates, share icons around the 
content. In both home and single post pages, it is nicer to display a few of the 'next' articles 
to attract visitors to read more.

The blog index page will simply output a list of all the articles in the same way the next 
articles were shown on home & single-post pages (pagination yet to be done!).

I also created `_include` templates which I can reuse throughout the site, for example 
to format date, display tags, show 'next' articles, add share icons etc and I highly recommend 
you do the same too. 
 
**Although you may use my template, it maybe worth adding a bit of your touch to make it 
fully yours.**
